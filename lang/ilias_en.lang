tst_median_title_long#:#Median Score
tst_median_title_short#:#Median
tst_median_description#:#The median score sorts the list of reached points on this test and takes the middle value if the total attemps are odd or the average between the two middle ones if the total attemps are even. The median score is not sensitive for extreme values.
tst_mean_title_long#:#Mean Score
tst_mean_title_short#:#Mean
tst_mean_description#:#The mean score is calculated as the the sum of scores divided by the number pf participants. It is sensitive for extreme values.
tst_standarddeviation_title_long#:#Standard Deviation
tst_standarddeviation_title_short#:#Standard Deviation
tst_standarddeviation_description#:#The standard deviation measures the amount of variation of scores reached for the test. A low standard deviation indicates that the scores tend to be close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates that the scores results are spread out over a wider range of values. It is calculated with Bessel's correction, i.e. the denominator uses the number of paricipants minus one.
tst_standarddeviation_only_one_participant#:#The standard deviation is trivial when the test is taken only by one participant
tst_cic_title_long#:#Coefficient of Internal Consistency (Cronbach's alpha)
tst_cic_title_short#:#Cronbach's alpha
tst_cic_description#:#Internal consistency is usually measured with Cronbach's alpha, a statistic calculated from the pairwise correlations between items. Internal consistency ranges between negative infinity and one. Cronbach's alpha will be negative whenever there is greater within-subject variability than between-subject variability. Values for a test should be greater than 0.7.
tst_cic_min_qst_title#:#Minimum Questions

tst_cic_sum_of_mean_is_zero#:#The sum of mean is zero
qst_facility_title_long#:#Facility Index
qst_facility_title_short#:#Facility Index
qst_facility_description#:#The facility index is calculated as the relation of the distances between average and minimum and between maximum and minimum of the reached scores, expressed as a percentage. The higher the facility index, the easier the question is. The index should be in a range between 20% and 80%.
qst_facility_min_ans_title#:#Minimum Answers

qst_standarddeviation_title_long#:#Standard Deviation
qst_standarddeviation_title_short#:#Standard Deviation
qst_standarddeviation_description#:#The standard deviation measures the amount of variation of scores reached for the question. A low standard deviation indicates that the scores tend to be close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates that the scores are spread out over a wider range of values. It is calculated with Bessel's correction, i.e. the denominator uses the number of answers minus one.
qst_discrimination_title_long#:#Discrimination Index
qst_discrimination_title_short#:#Discrimination Index
qst_discrimination_description#:#The discrimination index evaluates if the question separates 'good' from 'weak' participants. It calculates the relationship of the question result to the final test result. A discrimination index of 0,4 bis 0,7 is desirable. if the index is lower than zero than weak participants solve the question instead of good ones.
qst_discrimination_zero_variance_of_question#:#The variance of points is 0 for this question
